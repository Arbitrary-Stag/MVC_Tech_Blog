## Description
This is the twelvth challenge of the UC Berkeley Web Development bootcamp in which we were challenged to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. The app must follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. Finally, the app must be deployed to Heroku.
