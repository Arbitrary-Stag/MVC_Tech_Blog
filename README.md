## Description
This is the twelvth challenge of the UC Berkeley Web Development bootcamp in which we were challenged to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. The app must follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. Additionally, the app must be deployed to Heroku.

## Usage
To use this tech blog, simply navigate to the deployed link at the bottom of this README. From there you will be able to see all blog posts. By clicking on the blogs title you will be directed that individual blog post where you can read the entire article as well as any comments that have been added. If you wish comment or create your own blog posts, you will first need to signup. To do so click the login link in the top right. From there you will have the ability to login if you have a user profile, or there is a link at the bottom of the form that you can click that will redirect you to page in which you can create an account with a valid email address. If you are unresponsive for a while you will be automatically logged out and prompted to login again if you wish you to use certain features, like posting and commenting.
